When i see this details i start thinking what important to me to check :
How many requests are handled in a period of time (QPS).
Average response time.
Request rate.
Error rate.
Network traffic (packet lost ) due to massive amount of request .
How many resources (CPU, memory, I/O) are being used.

The solution i will use for this :
Prometheus + Grafana with alerts ( collecting all the relevant information and can be displayed in Grafana Dashboard).

Challengaes :
I think to verify that all the reuests arriving to the destination to monitor and check the logs alerts and minimize the problems to minimum.
